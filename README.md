# ProjectONPS
Online National Polling System

The project was developed by our team in when I started learning ASP.NET previous year.
The Project is devided into three module.
You can get the standard specification of the project by googling the term ONPS.
Lastly, I would like to say that it has many loop holes and not suitable for any other thing rather than Learning the Basics.
